Now I'm in the studio so intoxicated
I gave up my dreams of being nominated
But I do give a shit, I guess I'm complicated
I'm just waiting for the day to tell my mom I made it

[Chorus: Danny, Funny Man, J-Dog, All]
Everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
You've become a part of me
And all the love you've shown (All the love)
Is worth the blood I bleed
This is all I know (This Is all I know)
What I was born to be
So take a forty to the head
'Cause you're rocking with the best
Every single one of us is undead
Undead
[Verse 3: Johnny 3 Tears]
Can't even count the times I lost my fuckin' mind
Pulled back from the brink, got back to my feet, why?
There ain't a pill in this world that can save me
And I swallowed every one they ever gave me
But I have you, that's my one truth
Only shoulder that I had were the speakers hear me come through
And what I wanna say, there were so many days
That I wished I was a ghost and I could just fade away
Hide the pain underneath the surface
But you saved me, gave me a purpose
I don't know, maybe I deserve this
But now I know that my pain isn't worthless
I do this for the ones that I bled with (Bled with)
The ones that sing-along, that I keep it undead with
This is for the ones that gave meaning to my life
This is Hollywood Undead 'til I die

[Chorus: Danny, Funny Man, J-Dog, All]
Everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
You've become a part of me
And all the love you've shown (All the love)
Is worth the blood I bleed
This is all I know (This Is all I know)
What I was born to be
So take a forty to the head (Head)
'Cause you're rocking with the best (Best)

Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we've lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seem to end
Are we just ladders in the world of snakes?

I was born as a bastard, no father, no master

Take a look into these desperate eyes
As they’re cast into the wretched hive
But I ain’t going down alone

So will I stand here all alone?

[Verse 1]
지켜봐 왔잖아 니 사랑을 긴 이별을
늘 상처받을 바엔 난 게 나아

[Pre-Chorus]
똑바로 봐 우는게 싫어서 그래
아픈게 힘들어 그래
그런 널 볼 때마다

[Chorus]
(Three, two, one)
내꺼 하자 내가 널 사랑해 어
내가 널 걱정해 어
내가 널 끝까지 책임질게
내꺼 하자 니가 날 알잖아 어
니가 날 봤잖아 어
내가 널 끝까지 지켜줄게

Do you hear me?
Do you hear me? Oh

내가 널 걱정해 어
내가 널 끝까지 책임질게
[Outro]
다투진 않을까 상처 또 안을까
끊임 없는 아픈 고리에
항상 소리 없는 전쟁 넌 무리해
걱정의 방패로 난 니 앞에
나는 달 처럼 니 주윌 돌고 돌아
불이 꺼져 버린
니 사랑은 놓고 날 봐
깊이 패여 버린 상처 덮어줄게
웃게할게 내걸로 만들게Embed"

So what we hang out

[Verse 1: Andrew]
Hey, let me tell you about a place out east
Just Fifteen minutes from the LA streets
Hollywood doesn’t even know we exist
Like it's a mystical land, filled with immigrants
The food's authentic, the price is perfect
Where restaurants focus on the taste not service
Be ready to share 'cause it's family style
Time with the fam, makes granny proud!

We're far enough from LA where nobody's actin' phony!
Except maybe on our taxes, it’s cash only!
Tell the health department stop hating
’Cause a B rating stands for better tasting
Where kids drink more milk tea than liquor
And they roast more duck than Swishers
It's the 6-2-6, man check the address
Home of Sriracha and Panda Express

[Verse 3: Andrew & David]
Sometimes I wonder, am I still in America
How come there’s still a language barrier?
If you need help, read Yelp, check the reviews
My Elite friends make it easy to choose
There's traditional rivalries between high schools
They started back when there was still some white dudes
No matter where you go they can't match the price
So you're always coming back to the Cafe Life
If J-Town's got sake and K-Town soju
What do we have? Oh yea we got bobas
Hot spots to get some, hot pot and dim sum
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
From Shanghai to Saigon, Tokyo to Taiwan
Beijing to Hong Kong something to bite on
Valley, Atlantic, Garvey, I drive on
3 in the morning, cafes got their lights on

So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV

The first stop PCH and atlantic, the homefront
Poly apartments where the party still jumps
From dusk to dawn, makin me yawn, cuz I'm out late
Smokin in the cut with the homies, 86 the date
Don't feel like trippin tonight, so I get back
More concerned with my paper, cause now I'm on contract
Wonderin if this meal ticket a guarantee
Me a way out of the Eastside of LB
But you know like I know, ain't no place like home
Gone for a second best believe that I'm back home
24-7 where the love just don't stop
Comedian done tell the homies on the block
Get together, cuz ain't nothin changed but my mood
I might get to tweak and start to trippin on fools
But I chill, I hangs with them niggas that's real
Headed to the Eastside nigga you know the deal

Now as time passes by I sit and wonder where it all went
Days at King Park when free lunch was the lick
Hangin out baggin with the homies on the block
Some workin jobs, others slingin rocks
Blazin up that thai bumpin shit from way back
All my niggas in the cut tryin to keep away from flack
Everybody drinkin so we all gotta stroll
Some drinkin 8-Ball others black and gold
Gotta get my hair cut so you know I gots to peel
Bellin back from PCH on my way to Bobby Neal's
Tighten up my fade make a stop at VIP
I'm on the lookout, the latest hit from DJ Warren G
At night we steppin scandlous tryin to party with the skirts
Wit a glass in your hand, time to put in work
The Eastside steady dippin plenty drama in the name
Wit nine into that nine folk peepin everything

Chorus

I step right out the club to the party by my mama house
It don't close till four and everybody still hangin out
Just-a-laughin, talkin, crackin them jokes
Got the munchies like a mutha we still gonna smoke
Loc I know I can't make it to the nickel tonight (And why is that?)
Chocolate Thai got me through for the night
So carry on cuz I'm gone in the wind my friends
Showin' nothin' but the love for the city I'm in

Jeden Tag auf Opiaten, Schlafen ist mein Hobby

Dicka, wie'n Wikinger, Norddeutscher bis ich sterbe
23 Zoll Chrom, paar hundert Pferde
Guck in die Sterne auf Jamaika und bin high
Eine Flasche Rum, ja und? Vielleicht trinken wir zwei
Heh, Rapper verkaufen ihren Arsch
Bonez hat rote Augen, sitzt im Auto und gibt Gas
Richtige Brüder gibt es wenig, falsche gibt's viele
Ich schließe ab und zieh' 'ne Nase aufm Rückspiegel
187 bis zum Schluss, ihr wisst es selbst
Dicke Schlitten, lass' mich bitten, mache Plus und fick' die Welt

Die Bitches, die ich ficke, sie sind scharf wie die Waffen
Du kannst gar nix mehr machen, schiebst Panikattacken
Gibt es Streit, lass' ich kein Gras drüber wachsen

Das ist Realität, heute geht's der Mannschaft gut
Kenn's auch anders, manchmal schlägt das Leben ganz hart zu
Denn während du mit dreißig noch bei Mama wohnst
Hieß es für Gazi damals, erste Wohnung: Santa Fu
Ah, manchmal geht man in Knast (Ja, ja)
Auf der Reeperbahn nachts zu viel Jäger im Glas
Ein paar Fehler gemacht, trotzdem Tränen gelacht
Wenn du 'n Problem mit mir hast, komm, dann regeln wir das (Was, was?)
Digga, dieser Part hat keine Message
Nein, weil Gazi will nur Scheine scheffeln (Scheine scheffeln)

Ohh, wir müssen schnell machen, woll'n es selbst schaffen
Gummibänder für die Geldbatzen
Weil die Schlampen wollen Pelzjacken

3,4XHQyvbrBsQaaBUW1VvmsL,D12,My Band,"I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because these
You might also like[Chorus 1: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

[Post-Chorus 1: Eminem & Swifty McVay]
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band
Alright, okay, alright
Baby, yeah, give me that mic, man
Okay, dawg, give—come on, man! Dude!
Give me this mic! Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay & Kon Artis]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you? (Uh-huh)
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools? (God dang)
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And nah, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back
[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis & Eminem]
Look at Em, little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Ayy, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo, Em! You got somethin' to say?! Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up, and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever! I swear, man!

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof, Eminem & Kon Artis]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold-out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo, wh—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get ninety, and we only get ten percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem, Bizarre, Bizarre & Eminem]
Girl, why can't you (Roxanne, Roxanne)
See you're the (Bizarre will be your man)
Only one for me?
And it just
Tears my ass apart
To know that
You don't know my
Name! Man, fuck this

[Chorus 2: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band (Haha)
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
'Cause once I blow, I know that
I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the new slim...
*Blends* *Laughs*

[Post-Chorus 2: Eminem & Bizarre]
My band, my band (Your band)
My band, my band (Our band, your band)
My band, my band (You man, you man)
My band, my band (Roxanne Shanté)
My band (Lesbian)
Yeah, ayo
The hardest boy band in the world
D12!
[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, woah, woah
Look out for my next single, it's called
""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa
Where'd everybody go?...100Embed"

You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots

Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no business, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen no parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme

But it wadn't no mo' lights in the house, check it out
Speakin' of house, let's play a game of it
Are ya wit' it? Hide and Go Get It, I betcha love it, baby
I'll play the daddy, and you can play the mama
So we can get down upon the livin' room flo'
Are ya wit' it? I promise I won't kill it
Puddy-cat on the loose — what should I do? Should I kill it? Yeah!

[Pre-Chorus: Michel'le]
See, back in the day, when we used to play
You wanted to be with me (That's right)
Now that is so right and natural
No other man that I can see
I'm sinkin' in my background
Diggin' up a hole for you to make your move
But no longer will I feed your ego
Let's play house

Engine, engine, number nine (Let's play house)
Rollin' down the DP line (Let's play house)
Engine, engine, number nine (Let's play house)
Rollin' down the DP line
(Isn't that what you want me to do with you?)
You play the mama, baby, I'll play the daddy
(Let's play house)
You can play the mama, and I'll play the daddy
(Let's play house)
You can play the mama, and I'll be the daddy
(Let's play house)
And I'll be the daddy that runs the house, straight up!

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
I'm in the shack, 'bout to blaze up a sack
Yeah, we grown, all alone, posted up in the back
There's no mistakin', I can have the whole house shakin'
Young Daz in dat ass, baby doll, no fakin'
Don't get me wrong, tell me what's the flavor of the song
You know it's Daz in your drawerz when ya mama ain't home
Ring the alarm, I got ya buzz, lovin' me
Physically and mentally, I knew that it was never meant to be

[Verse 3: Kurupt & (Snoop Dogg)]
I know you know this girl by the name of Danielle
Body of a goddess, face from Hell
But oh, shhh! This wasn't the average trick (She got the bomb)
And she like gobblin' and swallowin'
The whole nine-and-a-half on dat black ass
Groupie, now all the hoochies wanna do me from the past
To the present (Say what?) Let me rep and present
(Who dat?) The biggest nigga hittin' all da hoes in yo' clique
Fast as lightnin', runnin' through like the breeze
In the summertime, out on the corners makin' G's
It's the thirst, but I can ya show somethin' much worse than the thirst
If worst came to worst, but first things first
Brenda, I can remember
How hot y'all be gettin', '87, '86 and
Yeah, the year a young man grows
Some women become ladies, some turn into hoes
Young hoes grown find a way to stay wit' me
In da cut wit' Kurupt, come and play wit' me, yeah!
[Outro: Michel'le & Nate Dogg]
If ya wanna be wit' me, stay wit' me, play wit' me
Come correct when you step to me
My, sweet, baby
If ya wanna be wit' me, stay wit' me, play wit' me (Let's Play House)
Come correct when you step to me (Let's Play House)
My, sweet, baby (Let's Play House)

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen
Who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at sixteen
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination madе my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to gеt the dough off
Stickin' up white boys on ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-tight clique and went all out
Catchin' ki's from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPVs, every week we made forty G
Yo, brothas, respect mine or here go the TEC-9, ch-pow
Move from the gate now

It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin'
But I'm alive on arrival, I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause **** deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed, I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not touch (Touch)
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask, what's it worth?
Ready to give up, so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young Black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic
[Chorus: Method Man & Inspectah Deck]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all (Do what they gotta do to get through, know what I'm sayin'?)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. (Because you can't just get by no more)
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all (Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Outro: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. 
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all, yeahEmbed"

Jetzt setzt es richtig was wie der Boss beim Poker (Ey)
Wenn er wieder mal um sein Haus spielt wie die kreischenden Blagen
Mit ihm feiernder Stars aus den Vereinigten Staaten (Wuhu)
Stars wie Eva Longoria
In der Hood geh'n Gs geduckt, denn Kollegah ballert jeden Tag rum wie Alkoholiker
Sammelt Kiefernholzmobiliar aus dem siebzehnten Jahrhundert
Und Spiegel, in denen er sich beim Trainieren selbst bewundert (Yeah)
Bring' den Trizeps in Form, den Bizeps in Form (Aha)
Und definier' den Körper wie'n Anatomielexikon
Ich muss stark sein, denn allein meine Armbanduhr wiegt sechzig Tonn'n (Hahaha)
MCs machen auf Pimp, aber haben grad mal so viel Sex wie Nonn'n (Ja)
Rapper sind seltsam, rappen, dass sie Geld haben
Obwohl jeder sieht, ihr Biz läuft schleppend wie Hotelpagen
Die meine Gepäckkoffer voll Geld tragen
Sich hechelnd und schnell atmend hoch über die Treppen in Stock elf plagen
Und dann zusamm'nbrechen (Ah) und erstma' liegen bleiben (Oh)
Ich steige über sie drüber, stepp' in die Suite hinein (Haha)
Und zieh' 'ne Line, hah, eyo, Bitch, ich hab' ein Riesenteil
Und selbst in Krisenzeiten mehr Punchlines als die Bibel Seiten (Yes)
Ich schmuggel' im Benz Pep kiloweise
Angespannter Sixpack, Men's Health-Titelseite
K-O-Doppel-L, maskuline Bossaura
Deine Bitch im Hotel, Gangbang, Schocktrauma (Hah)
Du bist stocksauer, packst dir an den Kopf (Ohh)
Willst dich rächen, schickst mir deinen Bodyguard auf Stoff (Oje)
Doch den Uppercut vom Boss wird der Typ nicht überleben (Niemals)
Deutsche Rapper? Ich bin ihnen lyrisch überlegen (Tzah)
Bin ihn'n psychisch überlegen (Yeah)
Und sie seh'n, nachdem sie intensive Pimpslaps kriegen: Ich bin ihn'n auch physisch überlegen
Sie sind Untermenschen wie Boden
Ich verprass' in hochexklusiven Modeboutiquen umgerechnet hundertsechzig Million'n (Yeah)
Bunker' Cash in den Hosentaschen und du Bastard kriegst
Asthma, siehst du auf meine haushohen Plasma-Screens
Guck auf dein'n Body, du bist im Fitnessverein (Ja?)
Doch hast 'ne Frauenstatur so wie Liberty Island
Guck auf die Bitches, wie sie kreischen, der Boss tritt in die Eisen
Bis die Bridgestone-Reifen durchdreh'n wie Jack Nicholson in Shining
Guck aufs Ziffernblatt der Breitling
Guck auf die Hater, wie sie im Netz haten, doch im Real Life Blickkontakt vermeiden
Guck auf mein Business, für die Liste der zehn Reichsten
Fehlt nur'n klitzekleiner Tick, wie wenn Trick und Track zu zweit sind
Es ist Kollegah, Muskelberg (Ah), ich laufe mit Luftgewehr (Ah, ah)
Und Schuh'n aus Krokodil in der Hood umher, paar Shots durchsieben dein Nuttenherz
Du Tucke nervst, hör auf den Boss, hol mir deine Mutter her
Und wir verbringen die Zeit mit Doktorspielen wie Guttenberg
Während ich im Hummer sitz', deine Mama fick'
Trägst du Tangaslips und spritzt ab auf Manga-Clips
Dein Dad raucht Cannabis? (Ohh) Ja, das kann er, bis
Der Boss kommt und dem Nuttensohn beide Arme bricht
Kid, und du siehst mich den Mercedes parken
Flügeltür'n gehen auf, ich stepp' in Zeitlupe aus Nebelschwaden
Körper voller Edelmarken, überlegene DNA
Dein Tränengas hilft wenig, wenn ich stählerne MGs durchlade
Bullets durch dein'n Schädel jage
Ey, ich lass', wenn sie die Regel haben, Mädels blasen jeden Abend
Gebe Gas im Range Rover, fahre
Zu deiner Bitch, ey, ihr Sex-Life spielt sich ab, wenn du nicht da bist, wie Mailboxansagen
Vor Jahren tickt ich Stoff an Kids auf Skateboardanlagen
Heut seh'n sie staunend zu, wie der Boss ein bisschen melodramatisch
Im Licht der Neonreklam'n (Aha) cool vorm Maybach steht
Du stehst höchstens vorm VW wie U im Alphabet (Ja)
Ich bin multitaskingfähig, halt' die Uzi an dein'n Schädel
Drücke ab und geb's dabei grad zwanzig Groupies parallel, Kid (Yeah)
Und ich hoff', dass du mich da verstehst
Ein Uppercut und du fliegst in die Umlaufbahn vom Jupiterplanet (Uuuh)
See you later, du Bitch (Bitch)
Erzähl nicht, was für'n Player du bist
Denn der Boss rollt durch die Neighborhood, sitzt
Hinter mokkabraun getönten Fenstern mit Chicks im fetten Beamer
Kofferraumvermögen sechshundertsiebzig Hektoliter
Voll gestrecktem Pep, ich vercheck' die Packets an Ghettodealer
Der Chauffeur manövriert den King so wie Tekken-Spieler
Du Crack-Bitch bettelst mich nett an, dich auf dei'm Track zu featuren
Weg mit dir, Mann, deine Raptexte sind wack, versteck dich lieber
Oder der Mac hält Magnums und Tecs an dein'n Head und streckt dich nieder
Fetzt dich weg und du liegst da verletzt im Dreck mit zerfetzten Gliedern (Ah)
Kid, ich gleite über die Meeresoberfläche
Auf 'nem Segelboot, bespreche dort am Telefon Geschäfte
Mach' nachts in Edelclubs mit Szenedrogen Cash
Tick' Coke und E's an Prominente aus der Regenbogenpresse
Geh' mit AK-47
Auf dich los, denn du machst auf Pimp, aber daheim sieht man deine Bitch dann im Befehlston mit dir sprechen
Du musst zuhören, nicken und die Fußböden wischen
Denn du stehst unterm Pantoffel so wie Schuhgrößen, Bitch (Haha)
Meine Crew tötet dich, man sieht Blut strömen, bis (Aha)
Es Richtung Himmel in die Flughöhe von Zugvögeln spritzt
Und du hast Angst um deine Sister, hab' ich Gigs in deiner Stadt (Oje)
Denn letztes Jahr hatte ich ja bereits den Dick in deiner Slut (Jaja)
Und du sprichst von Heirat (Aha)
Doch ich treff' deine Chick im Nightclub
Ein, zwei Whiskey und sie sitzt im Maybach
Es brauch' nicht viel Einsatz, bis die Bitch sich freimacht
Der Aufwand ist ein minimaler wie Disney-Zeichner
Und ich seh' ihren Stringtanga (Hahh)
Denn ihr Minirock ist knapper
Als Trinkwasser in Kinshasa
Ich mach' ihr Hoffnungen, den Pimp zu heiraten
Und sie freut sich wie ein Kind zu Weihnachten (Wuhuhu)
Und sie reagiert auf mein bestes Teil mit Schreckensschrei'n (Jaa)
Auf deins auch, hehe, aber nur wegen deinen Geschlechtskrankheiten
Es wär besser für dich, jetzt zu schweigen (Bitch)
Oder von der Brücke zu springen und wegzutreiben mit Rettungsreifen
Denn siehst du den Mac aus dem Lexus steigen
Steht dein Leben auf Messers Schneide wie das Nesmuk-Zeichen
Zwischen dein'n Homes und meinen gibt's 'nen Größenunterschied
Denn meine Homies sind Schränke wie bei Die Schöne und das Biest
Du willst deinen Kadett parken (Oh)
Doch siehst den pechschwarzen Aston und erstarrst, denn sowas kennst du nur von Quartettkarten
Ich lass' deine Geliebte blow'n, diese Hoe
Hat dann zwar nur einen Schwanz zum Blasen, dennoch ist die Auswahl riesengroß
Kid (Haha), und du schreibst paar Punchlines auf das Blatt (Ja?)
Doch ich komm' und box' dich um, und du willst Anzeige erstatten (Ja, mach ma')
Ey, kein Ding, mach nur! Denn guck, deine Crack-Bitch
Behandelt mich vor Gericht wie ihren Esstisch und deckt mich
Renn zu den Bullen, aber du stirbst, nachdem du gesungen hast, als seist du Nate Dogg
Deine Gang zittert wie Michael J. Fox
Rapper zu ficken, ist leicht wie Kate Moss

Es zerbricht der Traum, hier schreibt das Leben die Geschichten auf
Meine Gegend ist gewaltsam aber nicht sehr laut
Die Sirene ist 'ne Quarte und die Lichter blau
Mehrere maskierte laufen scherbenklirrend in dein Haus
Im Lauf der Zeit wird man blind und taub, trist und grau
Einbrecher-Rap, geh mal weg mit deinem Discosound
Dreh des Mikro auf, Haze zieht dir die Stiefel aus
Ich nehm' dich mit in eine Welt in der man Kokaina raucht
Und Weed anbaut, man gibt Geld in 'nem Casino aus
Und schiebt dann Krise, weil sich schon seit längerem die Miete staut
Ich will hier raus, doch die Wege sind zu weit
Und deshalb dreh ich mir den Scheiß, der mich von Krebszellen befreit
Rappe nicht für Fame und die Karriere ganz allein
Nehm das Mic, denn mein Seelenheil steckt in jedem Reim
Nur die Allerwenigsten verstehen was ich hier schreib

Manche therapieren sich mit Weed, andere therapieren sich mit Flex
Manche spielen, andere müssen fliehen vor dem Gesetz
Wieder andere therapieren sich und dealen Packs
Während ich des Mikro checke, auf die Sieben und die Sechs
Und auch Bitches therapieren sich, verlieben sich in Gangster
Und verwechseln daraufhin die Liebe nie wieder mit Sex
Kriegen meine Nummer raus und schicken ein, zwei Snaps
Aber immer ist besetzt oder irgendwie kein Netz
Weil ich chill wie 'n Penner, doch Taschen dick und spliffe L-er
Aufn Berg mit meinem Pitt oder in irgendeinem Keller
Kann mein Spiegelbild nicht sehen und deshalb zieh ich von 'nem Teller
Oder Messerklinge an die Nasenspitze so gehts schneller
Helis, du hörst in meiner City die Propeller
Eine Situation ändert dich, aus Kindern werden Männer
Selbstläufer, meine Musik die ist der Renner
Und wenn net dann spitt ich wieder in meinem Viertel Acapella

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smilin' through your frown
I'm askin' baby boo are you down
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, Mr. I-get-around
My temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you're makin'
Baby why you fakin'? Strip naked get to love makin'
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize 'til that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Stop with the beeper, baby, listen
I know you're grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find

Let me apply the brakes
Baby, you're movin' too fast
My conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug?
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé, come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
And I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind

Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'

Oh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion
Who would have thought?
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends, I come scoop you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time

Now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans, priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came forward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed's left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother's body, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would have shared his brother's fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said, ""Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go away, and thus avoid his anger.""

So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon the steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his chariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back, just as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.

Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as he fell heavily from the car.

The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.

Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning workmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all mischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus himself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.

Meges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was a bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children, for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the dust.

And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was honoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes.

Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.

Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, ""Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from Lycia hither.""

Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew and made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus. ""Dear son of Capaneus,"" said he, ""come down from your chariot, and draw the arrow out of my shoulder.""

Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, ""Hear me, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me to come within a spear's throw of that man and kill him. He has been too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I shall not see the light of the sun much longer.""

Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him and said, ""Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not fight him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come, strike her with your spear and wound her.""
When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again took his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.

He killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with a sword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided his wealth among themselves.

Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his comrades to take them back to the ships.

When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, ""Pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly work among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man- unless indeed he is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.""

And the son of Lycaon answered, ""Aeneas, I take him for none other than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven's help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I have not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's stables there are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector's service, and if ever I get home again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my house, may some one cut my head off then and there if I do not break the bow and set it on a hot fire- such pranks as it plays me.""

Aeneas answered, ""Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go against this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man's onset while I look after the horses.""

""Aeneas."" replied the son of Lycaon, ""take the reins and drive; if we have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my spear.""

They then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son of Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to Diomed, ""Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get killed.""

Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: ""Talk not of flight, for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid of no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you spring Aeneas' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon's knowledge, and they bore him six foals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take them.""

Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. ""Great and mighty son,"" said he, ""of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try with my spear.""

He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out and said, ""You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out for long, and the glory of the fight is mine.""

But Diomed all undismayed made answer, ""You have missed, not hit, and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.""

With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus's nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his to tongue, coming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was reft of life and strength.
Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion in the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him and a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is called the ""cup-bone."" The stone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had not his mother, Jove's daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son. She protected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.

Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas's horses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so done he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued above all others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.

Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her, ""Daughter of Jove, leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at the very name of war.""

The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle, with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have his horses. ""Dear brother,"" she cried, ""save me, and give me your horses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Jove.""

Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew forward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where the gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them from the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her and caressed her, saying, ""Which of the heavenly beings has been treating you in this way, as though you had been doing something wrong in the face of day?""

And laughter-loving Venus answered, ""Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between Trojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with the immortals.""

""Bear it, my child,"" replied Dione, ""and make the best of it. We dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by the severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an arrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling about his knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.""

So saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with both hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Minerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. ""Father Jove,"" said she, ""do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so very fond, and while caressing one or other of them she must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman's brooch.""

The sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side. ""My child,"" said he, ""it has not been given you to be a warrior. Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and leave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.""

Thus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his armour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him, and thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming on for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said, ""Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off; think not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth cannot hold their own with the immortals.""

The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty sanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked at the bucklers about one another's breasts, hewing each other's round shields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to Mars, ""Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god.""

He then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars went about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. ""Sons of Priam,"" said he, ""how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress of the fight.""

With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. ""Hector,"" said he, ""where is your prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you could hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see not one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy; nevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their wives. See that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away their reproaches from you.""
So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing- while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff- heaps grow whiter and whiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses' hoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas, Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the Trojans- for it was she who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy with the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in their midst.

The two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless of the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even so did the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. ""My friends,"" said he, ""quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another's eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life nor name.""

As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the Trojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.

Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and Orsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.

Brave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars egged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas; but Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to nothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands and spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and committed the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front ranks.

They killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian warriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on his chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the son of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with a stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell from his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck him on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the chariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and shoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil till his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.

But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry rushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans. Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in front of Hector and now behind him.

Diomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river rolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts back in fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his men, ""My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods.""

As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in war. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but his lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.

Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong hand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first. ""Sarpedon,"" said he, ""councillor of the Lycians, why should you come skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were of old his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are falling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand.""

And Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, ""Tlepolemus, your father overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon's folly in refusing payment to one who had served him well. He would not give your father the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.""

Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw at the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his throat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell upon his eyes. Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but his father as yet warded off destruction from him.

His comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the weight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in such haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, ""Son of Priam, let me not he here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.""

Hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon the Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove's spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again, for the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.

Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who lived near him, owners of a fertile country.

Now when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to Minerva, ""Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the promise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked the city of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage thus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once.""

Minerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round it. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry.

Meanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with her own hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in front and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the flours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. ""Father Jove,"" said she, ""are you not angry with Mars for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason, while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and chase him out of the battle.""

And Jove answered, ""Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more often than any one else does.""

Juno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they reached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot. She hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in their eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. ""Argives,"" she cried; ""shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was so deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.""

With these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva sprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his chariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For the sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield irritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up the strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his horses and said, ""The son of Tydeus is not such another as his father. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.""

Diomed answered, ""I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if Jove's daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it in the field.""

""Diomed, son of Tydeus,"" replied Minerva, ""man after my own heart, fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on the other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.""

With this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed's life, but Minerva caught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars's stomach where his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he raised.

As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even so did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens. With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great pain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying, ""Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are continually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another's hands while helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have lain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpes, or have been eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in me.""

Jove looked angrily at him and said, ""Do not come whining here, Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring, and it was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been the son of any other god, you are so destructive that by this time you should have been lying lower than the Titans.""

He then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by his father Jove all glorious to behold.

But Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house of Jove.3Embed"

3,76wJIkA63AgwA92hUhpE2V,2Pac,Me Against The World,"It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby
You might also like[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby (Hey)
Me against the world (Ooh yeah)
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
[Verse 4: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it71Embed"

So viele Freunde, weiß nicht, mit wem ich häng'n soll
So viele Feinde, weiß nicht, wen ich erhäng'n soll
Auf Straße im Benz roll'n, mattschwarze Ledersitze
Nachts auf Asphalt, Taş knallt, Jägerinstinkt
Mach Platz, Räder driften
Ich mach' das, was keiner schafft, über Nacht eine neue Ära bringen
So will jeder klingen, hier trägt jeder Klingen
Vierundzwanzig Zentimeter, die in deine Leber dringen
