So I jumped on a private jet and I'm askin' the pilot the ETA
Lambo' parked on the landin' strip, everyone in my gang and my DJ paid
Why's my man talkin' 'bout inshallah? These times, he don't even pray
Why's my man wearing a Jesus piece?
How does she squeeze in them jeans? Big behind and petitest waist
Take time with the GBG, we don't beef nobody like GBK
Woke up on the wrong side of bed, so he's gonna get slappеd if I don't have my P's today
I love my young boy, I won't lead him 'stray, I'm stuck to Lil Bro likе PVA
Paid already, I don't need no hit song
We don't need ID, Lil Bro seventeen in the club, he ain't scrollin' TikTok
F's just saw him a thick one, ""Which one? Who do you want, bro? Pick one""
If I shoot my shot, I'll hit one, matter of time 'til I get them all ticked off
Alright

[Chorus: Central Cee & Lil Baby]
We can go band for band
Fuck that, we can go M for M
Quarter mil' for the Maybach truck
Double R with the factory rims
I got the 90, the Urus, the Virgil, the Brabus, I'm really a threat
It's got to the point that I don't even care
I got jewels in the safe that I don't even wear

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Central Cee]
Uh, bro'll do it for some shoes and some clothes, you'll see what he'll do for a necklace
'Rari truck look like a spider, it's crawlin' a dollar on just accessories (Damn)
She made me wanna go harder, I like her whole aura, I think I'm obsessed with her
They hit him up on his birthday, did him the worst way, he had a death wish
I get right under they skin, I don't even try, I guess I can't help that shit
I'ma have love for bro for life if we talk or not, I step with him, nigga
Of course you can beat me at talkin', ain't no back-and-forth, wait 'til we catch up with them niggas
Knockin' a bag and makin' the opposite mad, I done fell in love with it
UK Selfridges with a cute one (Ooh)
Bank account look good, this a new one (Yeah)
You the type like to type on computers (Wow)
Got a mask, but he ain't no shooter (Haha)
Top ten, but she don't act bougie
Me and your friends can go to Aruba
Hit France, it depend on my mood
This a Maybach van, this ain't no Uber
We can go band for band
Fuck that, we can go M for M
Mama got a body like Kim and them
Mama been killin' that gym

With two tings looking like Keisha Becky
Got a sweet one, thick and friendly
Brown and boujie, leng and sexy
It's a fuckin' mess, G
Blow out the back now, I'm on to the bestie
I got a thing for cash in the bank
I shut down the show that's cash in the bank
Everybody thought the boy went ghost
Till I step out the mist and come back with a bang
None of you boys actually bad
Just act for the 'Gram and it's actually sad
One wave to the world and back
If I'm making a bag, then I'm splittin' it with squady
(Bowl too—) Bowl too hard, too bossy
Fuck an escort, never paid for a prossy
I got a pretty one that wanna bounce on my cocky
She a litty one, I told her to wait in the lobby
Young three five in the whip, man burn that
Quit then it's back to the bits

Big bro got a nine, but it shoulda been less
I can tell you 'bout riskin' it all
If this car gets spun, then I'm lookin' at ten
Double-R, oral sex, that's Cullinan head
Rappin', still tryna put it to bed
No leg-shots, still gotta push it in chest
Archin' her back, gotta jook it the best
Nut in her face, now she lookin' a mess
All of my paigons lookin' depressed
If rap don't work, then I'm lookin' at 'Rex
Got my guy in the can, now he lookin' a TEC
Future's bright, still lookin' to step
Tellin' her friends I been hittin' her up
That's crazy, I want her to hold this glee, I ain't lookin' for sex
Told the guys, ""Chip in what you can
Me and broski will put in the rest""
I learned how to whip, no theory or practical
And I ain't lookin' at tests
Don't know if she's buzzin' or tryna impress
Came out and don't know why she's got on a dress
Known for pullin' up outside a paigon's house
Whenever we got an address
I seen **** get his lungs all punctured
Literally watched him run out of breath
HMP need to hand him couple of trackies, couple of creps
If she finds it hard to keep it shush
Then that's one ting won't trouble again
Feds at my door, I'm in trouble again
Opp block, tryna burst his bubble again
ZK over the flickers
But I've seen man get done worse with the flick ting
Left man red then blue on a Crip ting
And I still ain't put it in crypto
Met so many akhs in jail
Mashallah, but bro, I'm a Christian
An O-P-P got splashed in his head
We basically went to a paigon's Christenin'
Don't televise when I go on a glide
Don't bring my phone on a ride, 'cause I mean it
Blood on my knife whenever I see them
Two days and I bet you I beat it
Wrist on froze, fingers, mouth
It's a hot summer's day, but you know that I'm freezin'
And, no, I ain't got amnesia
I ain't forgotten what happened on G Wing

I couldn't afford them kicks, I had one pair, and I cleaned them rigorous
Squeezed in junior, I feel like Vinícius
Young Gs stupid, but, they ain't idiots
It's scary, trap insidious
How you expect us to know how to love, you know?
I can't teach no one how to hustle, some man just got it
Back then I got chased by feds, I ran out of breath and I wanted to vomit
I hit that freak, she put me in cuffs, it triggered my trauma, I tell her to stop it
She wanna know if I'm really ballin', that girl there wanna weigh my wallet

[Verse 2: Central Cee]
We ain't doin' irrational get backs, creep up clean when they least expect it
Hygiene's poor, look at the floor, there's insects crawlin', I could've got sepsis
Nasty, still try fuck on my step-sis (Huh)
Ran through nuff of these famous girls, but I still got some on my checklist
Bare gunman on my guestlist
I took bro-bro out of the trenches
Jump out the Volvo, jump out the Lexus, active
He ain't got no preference, slapped it
But, when in retrospective, I could've been calm and collected
Avoided a problem and fleed the scene
Too vocal, don't need no beat
I go old-school like Evisu Jeans
Who's that with the cargos and Corteiz?
The back poke out and the waist petite
Got flown out all the way to Greece
She got great physique

I'll send a delivery text, I know that it's wrong, it is what it is
Broski locked, I'm visitin' him
Brought eaters to the prison for him
Vision for him, and it's bigger than him
Disrespect, I'm sizzlin' him
That girl look like SZA to me
How you upset that I cut you off when you basically handed the scissors to me?
Two-man step, diligently (Grrah)
Watch my back vigilantly
My young boy do man differently
She wanna show them girl she know me, call my government name
I never tucked my shirt in school, so why would I grow up and tuck my chain?
Hide my face like, ""Fuck the fame""
Trusting different, but love's the same

[Verse 4: Central Cee]
I don't trust anyone lately, this lifestyle sendin' me crazy
Who's to say that they'll never betray me? Rusty one from the 1980s
But the new plate, a millennium baby
She deserve a standin' ovation the way that she got on her knees and ate me
Two hands, Lord Jesus, save me
We all know the industry's fake, the streets fake as well
Stand up for my rights like Santan Dave, them man stand up like Dave Chappelle
You can lock the lock, but the trap don't stop
Half of the block get paid in jail
That was a risky text before
And, now it's no danger, I'm on a major scale
[Verse 5: Dave]
That was a risky text before, if I send that now, there ain't no danger
The way that the light bounce off of these GIAs make gyal act stranger
Got love for all of the young Gs bookin' a flight, and I'm headed to Asia
Four and a baby goin' away, times were hard, I slept in a manger
Give her the Trojan, give her the Trojan Horse, I feel like Troy
Had a revolver, decomposin' hid in the woods, I feel like Roy
She give me a wine, blood rush to my genitals
Lucky for me, she can feel my—
Is it right? Won't say that it is
Shame that it is and it is what it is

[Verse 6: Central Cee]
Oi, Dave, I don't even wanna release (Why?)
I don't wanna be mentioned in the same sentence as none of these creeps
I don't wanna come to your session, I don't wanna jump on none of your beats
We can talk 'bout direct debit, my monthly payment a hundred Gs
Taxman on me, I keep receipts
My biggest paigons HMRC (Huh)
Bro got it in Masjid, he got a mad ting under his kameez
Bad one watchin' her calories, long ting, 'cause, I wanna go out to eat
Hella petite like Bella Hadid, so I handle it delicately, she kind of surprised I got elegant speech

[Verse 7: Dave]
I got a ting from DC, Harley Quinn, feel like the Joker
Back then, I had my nank in Dallas, Texas hold 'em, me and my poker
Antisocial, I'm a loner
He got done up in mid-November and didn't recover 'til late October
You'll need more than sling on a shoulder
Young black Brit in Italian kit, I feel like Tammy in Roma
I had the Range with the extra seats, so I squeezed that bitch in the back of the Rover
Cliffs of Dover, white on sea
Who's that there on the C2C?
She want a man with decent P
And her ex is a factor, Misha B
Let's not talk 'bout makin' a mill', this year, I average one in a month
Had a vision of runnin' it up, and it's workin' well like rum in a punch
In DLT I ain't come for a brunch

I have plans of a cash and carry, my legs were dry, my elbows ashy

But when I slide 'round, I don't see him
Or he's breezin' like a athlete
The whole squad know I back beef
Treat restaurants like they're McD's
Taught my young boy how to stack P's
I came up off a crack fiend (Crack friend)
Throwin' this paper, no litterin'
Aged fifteen, I was bit'n'win
I'm eating in Gaucho's, you're getting slim, I need two scales when I get it in
Cooked two Z's in ten minutes
I gotta trap spot, I'm rentin' it
Just cling and carbs, no beds in it
And I'm out the door if a feds in it
Done a lotta shit, I ain't regrettin' it
I get the raw and I'm extending it
If the coke's hard then I'm blending it
I dont know nuttin' 'bout no benefits
[Bridge]
Young niggas gettin' street money till they lock me
I got a white girl with a big back, she talks Cockney
They see the kid and they skate out, it's not hockey
Keep the dots in the gym bag, true, it's stocky

[Chorus]
Fuck them, I don't know them, they ain't one hunna
In my German car, drop a big pack on my young gunner
In the trap, I make mad stacks off one number
When you're at the pot, you can lose it all off one fuck up8Embed"

Never have I been AG, but I got big boy crocodile teet'

Put him in a box like Jordan 3, pop corn, let bad boy drop to his knees (Switch)
They can never do it like me, SR, I make racks in my sleep

Now back to the real life facts
I made more than half of a mill' off a track, now everyone's hatin' on man (And again)
If I wife your gyal and she cheats on me, one hunna, I'm doin' it back
[Chorus: SR & Poundz]
Yo, what's good, what's good?
Guns on the block, now everyone's shook
Sweetie wanna do me on a late night, she don't even know badman been a crook

[Verse]
If you heard that corn was slappin', I was probably there when it happened
He thought he was bad so we put the boy up like Aladdin
I put my shank in Biggz then put my shank in bleach
I thank God I never got it like Clinton, he got shanked to sleep
Civils always gotta try play hero, I can't even wave my shank in peace
If he ain't gonna rise it, you better rise that piecе for he, at least
Steppеd same day, I couldn't take defeat, it's peak
He thought he was sweet then he held this sweet
No need for speaking, put his face on a T
I see bro jump out on a fast ting while I'm parking, he weren't waiting for me
When we fly out the coupe and shoot, we ain't giving leg shots, ask Rage that's proof
We up the G-Lock then see him speed off
Reload it, cock back, squeeze off
Bine nearly took him and half the seat off
I chinged man's face then he fell to the floor
I coulda left him but I chopped him more
Bro didn't like him so I chopped him chopped him, I didn't even know what I chopped him for
My reactions action, when the mash popped off you coulda heard it in Acton
If nothing got (woosh), there's no satisfaction
Corn only missed my man by a fraction
We came to the drop; two poles up
Nothing like the sun but the heat rose up
Last time I was in Wendover and I went over, I see knees go up
I done more than a handful of chingings and gang's done more than a handful of killings
My young boys just wanna do drillings
He got a rambo bigger than me, bigger than him and he keeps it with him
It's us that ride and it's them that die
Look him in the sky, how'd he get that high?
When I said ""Bro pass, let me rass this guy""
I coulda hit passers passing by
I won't lie he had heart now his arse is high
I just seen a man dart while I'm asking why
Gotta shout GBoy he's the fastest guy
It's a shame that Clints was slow, I swear he woulda made it if the prick weren't slow
Latex so the prints don't show and you could never claim Pecks cos the kids don't roll
The same day I put my shank in Biggz
Squeezo put his shank in Blacks
I coulda caught an M charge when I was shanking Caps
If he's one of them dargs, better shank him
Made it clap, spanking (Brrt)
Outside the gaff, camping
It coulda been a shotgun or a hand ting (Woosh, woosh)
He ain't doing it now, he's a has-been
Put him in the air, send him next to the clouds (Where he at?)
Civils got hit because they ran to the clown (Woosh)
It coulda been LD, Suspect going round (Going down)
If not, it was me with suttin' that's loud
Smoke in the air, man's preeing them fumes
Violate in the morning, you're gonna hear suttin' got wooshed by noon (Woosh, woosh)
He came in khaki now his tops maroon (Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh)
We don't know karate, we got mops for shoot
When I had no firearm, what did I do?
I had to hold him down and split him in two (Ying that)
I weren't done even there, I'd already given him two
Circle again, catch him on the rebound (Spin that)
He didn't have a lifeguard so he drowned
Bring out the gauge, let him know how the heat sound
Where the fucks BGod in B-Town
Them man said I ain't been but I been round
He already felt my ying on the roads, now he's in the wok house getting a beat down
We put shots in the air then breeze out
Man's saying what's real, I don't glamourise
When I yinged my man with a samurai I tried to make sure that the yute don't have a eye
I ain't the one to antagonise, ask Lil A when we left him paralysed
Spin that block like say I don't have a life
Pull up on yutes, pull up blaze, won't have a fight
Someone got cheffed and I lost my appetite
Corn in the air looking like one discus
One got it on New Year's Day, peak when another one got it on Christmas
I had MB doing up fitness, when I caught OS, God's my witness
Put this dot to his head like a Hindu
Multiple shots get sent, we spin through
It's only us that know what we been through
It coulda been a .32, .38, .44, 9m, ain't one we ain't been through

Me and her man no similarity
Hold that L if you hit that after me

3,5gpyyqA9WZyWu24ESUzrkk,Central Cee,LA Leakers Freestyle,"They think I'm the one that can bridge the gap, huh
I came to LA to work, but first, where the bitches at?
They're tellin' me Tao or The Highlight Room
If you wanna go through, you gotta bring the strap (Okay)
No way could I trust these hoes, I'm takin' their phone if we bring them back
I don't wanna get done, like, nah (Come on)
They don't understand, I'm givin' them U.K. slang
My brudda, my fam', my akh
You say ""The feds just done a sweep""
We say, ""The boy dem run in my gaff""
You say ""On God, no cap""
We say ""Swear on your life, don't gass""
You say ""Spin the block""
We say ""Jump out and slide and crash""
You call it ""machine,"" we call it a ""mash""
Strip club and they're shakin' ass
But in my words, they're shakin' nyash
We don't trap in abandoned buildings
Shots get hit out of vacant flats
In other words, ""apartments,"" hidden compartments get detached
Free all the members that got bagged
You say ""What's up?,"" we say, ""Wagwan""
Got shotguns from a farm
We don't eat pork, we say it's Haram
You call her ""shawty,"" we call her ""jawn""
Sexy gyal and we call them ""leng""
Back then, we would call them ""peng""
Bare words that we got for guns
Like ""waps"" and ""skengs""
You call them ""Js"", we call them ""cats""
There's not much crystal meth
My hoods got junkies hooked on crack
Flick knives, we call them ""nanks""
Zombie killers, we call them ""ZKs""
Rambo knife by the name of ""Ramz""
We say ""cash,"" ""Ps,"" ""racks,"" ""Gs""
We don't really call them ""bands""
In L.A, it's Escalades
In the ends, it's Mercedes Vans
Watch my back, I'm paranoid
That's what I mean when I say that I'm prang
Clench my fist and I fist bump man
Anti-social, I don't shake much hands, huh
Well, it depends
You say ""the trenches"", we say ""the ends""
You say ""y'all"", we say ""you lot""
You say ""restroom"", we say ""toilet""
We do have guns, but they might be
So man pull it apart and oil it
If a man violate, say a man boyed it
Live Yours ain't a gang, can't join it
We both whip crack the same
We fill up the Pyrex pot and boil it
In London, I'm verified
In N.Y, I'm valid
Twelve hours away, I'm M.I.A, I can pull up on DJ Khaled
It's only an hour away from the ends, that's why I spend time in Paris
If I pull up on Saturday Night, I ain't come here to talk, this ain't Jimmy Fallon (Ah, yeah)
I just pulled up with a chick bro said that he hit, I'm a bit embarrassed, huh
All she's gettin' is dick and Chick-Fil-A, we ain't eatin' salmon
I might hit one time and vanish, I got unlimited funds on the Amex
One day, I'm on the block in London, next day, I'm chillin' in the sun on a hammock, huh
Controversy sells
I said, ""How can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay"" and it flew off the shelf
Thinkin', ""Should I go with a label or stay independent and do it myself?""
Sat down with the boss and said I ain't signed, but, bro, I ain't new to deals, uh
Stood outside of the night club, try make the trap line kick like Flight Club
All of my drip from Rodeo Drive, ain't none of this shit from China, huh
I don't want Nobu, I need me a yard food, so I'm in Inglewood
Darg dem—
My darg dem serve like Wimbledon
My darg dem smart like Beethoven
I'm from where the JackBoys active
Fam, don't sleep with your window open
Hoes gon' line man up and get a commission
Back shot give a gyal whiplash
Hit that, impact like a collision
I don't care if I'm givin' the lo'
Tell Rubi Rose that I'm in the Edition
(Okay)
(That boy, man, West London is in here, man, Central Cee)

3,58BJ5oUPX5ST2pjCtOSMkk,Da Beatfreakz,"Money Calling (feat. RAYE, Russ Millions & wewantwraiths)","I rolled my spliff on the sunrise, half past 6
In a all-black Louis V drip
I can sleep when I get my fix
It's some very dark nights I've lived
Then I'm making those top-ten hits
See, I'm good at this pop star shit
Just 'cah I smile like this
Doesn't mean I can't take your bitch (Beatfreakz)
James, Jamal, and John
All of my exes singing my songs
Write my songs, and I write her songs
Life is sweet, and the money don't lie
Stand for my bitches, catch me outside
None of you know what I did to survive
Everyone who streamed that, followed that, played that back
Gee, thanks 'cah you changed my life
If I pull right now, it's a 100K minimum
Life feels good when you're making millions
Met a new ting, he was making billions
Got on one knee, so I had to get rid of him
Since 16, every night I pray
Now, I'm having dinner with B and Jay
I'm a Croydon girl where the pavement's grey
And I had no plugs, I paved my way, yeah
You might also like[Chorus: RAYE]
My pride too high, never asked you for help
Boy, you should pree the house I just bought for myself
Still in the ends, south London, baby
For what it's worth, I'm glad you played me
Now none of these men ever matter to me
Got my girls, got my cars, got my green and my weed
Know there be ring-ring, it's that money calling
This that shit you have to spend it to believe it, darling

[Verse 2: Russ Millions]
Number one, can't throw no shade
I make hit songs, not trap or trade (Shatai)
Hit that once and the pum-pum's great
I can't wife her 'cah she way too bait
More followers than Imjustbait
Touch my skin, you wouldn't make front page
I've got a big whip, man's due an upgrade
They wanna catch up, but it's way too late
Uptown with jewels, man's feeding
Taking a M when SK's peaking (Skrr, skrr, skrr)
I meant to see one girl that I'm jeeting
But I'm kinda late for a label meeting (Alright)
Princess, she look good this evening
Rubbin' my hood, ay, bae, stop teasing
Take off my belt, man push that deek in (Uh-huh)
Give her the pipe, that's central heating
[Chorus: RAYE]
My pride too high, never asked you for help
Boy, you should pree the house I just bought for myself
Still in the ends, south London, baby
For what it's worth, I'm glad you played me
Now none of these men ever matter to me
Got my girls, got my cars, got my green and my weed
Know there be ring-ring, it's that money calling
This that shit you have to spend it to believe it, darling

[Verse 3: wewantwraiths]
They ain't believe in me
Working harder like there's three of me
Used to pray I made a 100K
I'm breaking bread all day, I do it easily
One year in, I made a lotta changes
While these niggas out here tryna beef with me
Turned the page and now, I'm going places
Now, these Insta' baddies wanna sleep with me
I'ma jeet and skeet
My head is in the stars, and I can't ask you for help
All these scars that's on my back, I cut 'em open myself
When life gets hard, it'll be okay
It's me and RAYE in this brand new Wraith
It's baby blue, like Beyoncé
You better tell Jay 'bout wewantwraiths
[Chorus: RAYE]
My pride too high, never asked you for help
Boy, you should pree the house I just bought for myself
Still in the ends, South London, baby
For what it's worth, I'm glad you played me
Now none of these men ever matter to me
Got my girls, got my cars, got my green and my weed
Know there be ring-ring, it's that money calling
This that shit you have to spend it to believe it, darling

3,5ADkg291Tpx9mB0aU2cGFQ,Clavish,Traumatised,"Uh, if boy'dem pull up, know I'm cutting first
I was upset when bro got first blood 'cause I tried cuttin' first
This white girl more than average, make my number jerk
These dotty pellets spread, that's worse than a fuckin' germ
Erm, what's gonna help me live my bestest life?
Money up, bestest times
Them times, bro was still alive
I know he's gone, but he's still that guy
I've seen man get shot and stabbed, never left me traumatizеd
Real niggas turnin' fake left mе more surprised
I'll air out man for Jung, he'll do the same for me, I love that guy
Bando settings with some digi' scales and number nine
If we put our phone on flight mode, we'll be done by nine
Music pays, it's kind of aight
I still want a shot of Miley Cy'
Huh, got Miley Cyrus, opp shots know my name
Not my real one, if they did, I prob' would've caught a case
I'm the hood's hottest topic, might end up on Hall Of Fame
Can't get my shank mixed up with bro's, me and him don't bore the same
I'm way too fly, even when I don't pack my bags, I'm board the plane
Dip game nine, don't believe me? Go ask what's his face
CCTV don't mean shit if you mask up properly, ayy
That's cap, got members with me put you in check if you don't move properly, ayy
I got a savage with me, turn shit ugly like some morning face
Big homie aim for chest and up, no feet like Tory Lanez
A paigon estate just got taped, no cap, I'm all to blame
Got haters 'round me, the more I better myself, the more they hate
No paigon ho can't look in my direction, walk my way
No opp boy cancelled plans that vid' still got recorded, ayy
Streets is fake, rap game worse, I don't even wanna participate
Me and Kodak Black alike, I don't even rap, I illustrate
Have you ever rode on the opps?
Scared face showin', ""Please, don't shoot me""
I ain't taking check, better check your tone when you're chatting to me
Scrolling through Instagram, this one's the baddest cutie
But, if she ain't got more than ten put down, she can't be bad and bougie
Got TT cats, don't screw me
Can't say the same 'cause your ting meady
I made more money in jail than your boyfriend made on road, I ain't tryna be cheeky
Too much cats, I ain't tryna be greedy
Too much waps, I ain't tryna be swinging arms
Baby mum, don't leave me, so, scoring points is easy for me
Sometimes I wonder how much the yutes I beef wanna be me
All these bad bitches wanna beat me
Snakes dressed up as friends, wanna pree me
No cappin' man, believe me
Grew up in stolen cars
When we go on glides, we turn the headlights off so they know wagwan
