ロマンチックな人生は諦めてたけど
周りはカップルばかりで
それを合図だと、受け止めるべきかな？
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
寂しいよ
私を抱きしめてくれる恋人はいないかな
部屋に閉じこもって泣いちゃうよ
恋愛のことは疑心暗鬼になってしまう
それでももっともっと求めたくなるの

今ここにいるのは惨めな自分
その愛は本物じゃないってわからせたいのに
キューピッドは本当に馬鹿なんだね

迷子になったのか、どこかへ飛んでしまったのかな？
待ってはいられないよね

Let's break our plans
And live just like we're golden (Ooh)
And roll in like we're dancing fools (Like we're dancing fools)

[Post-Chorus: Jin, SUGA, V, Jung Kook]
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land (We know how to land)
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight (Ooh)
'Cause we don't need permission to dance109Embed"

[Куплет 1: Найон]
Ми не лягаємо спати до появи світла
Схід сонця зранку
І я не можу дочекатись нашого возз'єднання
Я можу допомогти полегшити твій розум

[Передприспів: Найон]
І навіть якщо ти іноді засмучений(-а)
Я можу бути тою, хто розвеселить тебе
Крихітко, коли ти почуваєшся пригнічено
Тобі просто варто дати мені знати

[Приспів: Найон]
Ні, немає жодної проблеми для любові
З тобою і мною сьогодні вночі
Ні, ніщо не зможе зупинити нас цього разу (Цього разу)
Не повинно бути плутаниць цієї ночі (Мм-мм)
Ні, немає жодної проблеми (Ні, ні) для любові (Для любові)
З тобою і мною сьогодні вночі
Ні, ніщо не зможе зупинити нас цього разу (Цього разу)
Не повинно бути плутаниць
Ні, немає жодної проблеми цієї ночі

[Куплет 2: Найон]
Для твого серця я кваліфікована
Нам не потрібна жодна розмова
Ми не повинні прощатися
Тому що, крихітко, ти зрозумів(-ла) мене правильно, у-у-у-у-у

Під зоряним небом цієї ночі
Йе, твої очі сяють яскравіше за неонові вогні, оу (Неонові вогні)
Гучні баси, ні, ми не бавимось (Не бавимось)
Заради твоєї любові, йе, я молитимусь (оу йе)
Я і ти, це один плюс один (вуу)
Я і ти, ні, немає нікого краще, нумо

والآن الجميع يضحكون علي

لأنني حزين جدًا
حزين جدًا على أن أرقص
أنا حزين جدًا على أن أرقص

[اللازمة]
لأنني انشغلت كثيرًا، أصدقائي يعلمون ذلك
قلب مكسور ولا أملك أحدًا
ولهذا السبب أنا حزين جدًا على أن رقص
و الآن أنا فقط أنتظر بجانب الهاتف
أنتِ لن تعودي وكان يجب أن أعلم
لهذا السبب أنا حزين جدًا على أن أرقص

Ah, it's like we're almost there and then I turn around and you're not there anymore
But how could you leave me in the club?
Okay, I guess you must've had enough
You were on fire, lost in your desire
I'm leaving later in case it gets better
If you're down to ride, everyone we know is out tonight
We could leave all our jobs today, maybe it's a secret holiday
Okay, everybody walk to the baseline now
Don't waste your time on talking (No)
Please, don't play my song (Play my song)
Focus on the way I'm walking
You can't get enough (Woah)
